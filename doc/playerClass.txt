Tree:
|--> name:      The player's first name.
|--> lName:     The player's last name.

|                 trouble.

|                 M: Male, F: Female, H: Hermaphrodite, N: Neutered/Neutral
|--> gender:    How the player identifies. Same as biological sex by
|                 default. uses the same letter mapping as 'sex.'
|                 (No, I am not being "PC" with this option, just having a
|                 little respect for other human beings. If this 'triggers'
|                 your autism, deal with it.)
